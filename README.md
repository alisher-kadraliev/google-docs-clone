How I Built a Google Docs Clone
I built a Google Docs Clone the goal was to create a real-time collaborative document editing expirience similar to Google Docs. Code in Github

Key Features:
✅ Creating and managing documents – Each user can create, edit, and delete documents. The documents stored all in Convex. Also users can create own organization and manage documents with groups.

✅ Real-Time Collaboration – To enable real time collabation i used Liveblocks. When user edits document, changes are instantly synced across all active sessions, each active user can see who make changes.


✅ Auto-Saving – I implemented an auto-save featers that periodically saves the documents to the database, ensuring no data loss.

Conclusion

Building A Google Docs Clone was a challenging but rewarding experience. Using some of new tech stack and smooth deploy to production with real-time editor feature was fun.
